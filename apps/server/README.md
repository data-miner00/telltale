## Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Donâ€™t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
- Add "{user} is typing" functionality.
- Show who's online.
- Add private messaging.
